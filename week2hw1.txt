Consider a scenario where you're a software engineer at a tech company that has just developed a
state-of-the-art generative AI model, one that has the ability to create highly realistic synthetic
media (deepfakes, articles, speeches, etc.). You have been tasked with creating a set of ethical
guidelines for the usage of this AI.
In your response, answer the following:
● Define what you consider to be 'ethical usage' of this technology.
-- Ethical usgae of AI is when it is not represented as a self generated or researched content.
 It is accepted as an AI generated information and this reduces the risk of trusting information as Ai can be non consistent in its responses. 


● Identify three potential risks or ethical dilemmas that could arise from misuse of this AI.
-- False information 
-- generate responses that are against company policy
--  Can also get users under legal conflicts as the generated content is not always reliable.


● Propose specific measures to mitigate these risks.
-- AI related courses to be mandatory at workplace as part of quarterly trainnings 
-- people should accept if thier solution is generated by AI.
-- 


Bear in mind the power dynamics that AI technology can influence. Reflect on the principles of
fairness, transparency, and accountability, considering how you'd ensure these in your approach.
Remember to think big-picture and recognize the potential global impact
